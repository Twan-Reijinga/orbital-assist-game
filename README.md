# Orbital Assist
Orbital Assist is a game made by Adam, Roemer, Thijs and Twan for the Game Jam of the Coderclass at Metis Montessori Lyceum 2022. <br>
On 8 July, everyone had seven hours to make a game that fits the theme *30 seconds*.
This game won in the category *originality*.

## How it works
Every round one or more satellites, planets and portals are visible.
The goal is to get the satellite into the portal with the same color.
You can't move the satellite, but you have to move the planets in a place where the satellite can use the gravity of the planet to steer.
The gravity of the planets are only effective if the satellite is inside the gravity-circle.
If the satellite escapes the map or touches a planet, you can try the level again.

After 30 seconds, the satellite(s) launch, and you can't move the planets anymore. If you are done before the timer runs out, you can use `Enter` to launch it right away.

## To-Do
We only had seven hours, and we were very surprised how far we've come in such a short period of time. This was for everyone the first time we did a
Game Jam, and we never expected to win a prize, but the game is obviously not done.

All the mechanics are there, but we didn't do much with level design, so there are only 5 level and every level has one satellite.
We also didn't make an end screen to our game, so if you finish it, you get a funny surprise. (not intended)

If someone wants to make more interesting levels, be free to fork the project.
